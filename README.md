## Title- Regional Distribution of Engineering Colleges and the impact of Reviews and Ownership on the popularity of colleges 
• Scraped 550 rows and 10 columns of data from an educational website (Careers360) analyzing engineering colleges in India. 

• Conducted univariate analysis with 3 types of visualizations (boxplots, histograms, count plots) to explore distributions and bivariate analysis 
using scatter plots. 

• Found private colleges were prevalent in states like Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, while government colleges scored higher ratings above 4. 
• College fees mainly ranged between 500,000-600,000 INR, with Sikkim and Rajasthan showing the highest averages. 

• Discovered college ownership and fee structure significantly influenced ratings and popularity, affecting more than 60% of colleges.
